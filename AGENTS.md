# Cluster API Provider K0smotron — Agent Guide

This document provides guidance for AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Codex,
Claude, etc.) working in this repository.

## Git Workflow — MANDATORY

- **Never commit changes** unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- **Never create a branch** unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- **Never open a pull request** unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Leave all changes as unstaged working-tree modifications by default.

---

## Shell Environment

This repository uses [**mise**](https://mise.jdx.dev) (`mise.toml`) to provide
the required tooling.

**Always run bash commands through mise-managed tools.** After installing
mise and trusting the repo (`mise trust && mise install`), the tools defined
in `mise.toml` are available directly on `PATH` via mise's shims/activation,
so commands can be run as-is:

```bash
scripts/generate-template
yamllint .
```

If mise is not activated in your shell, prefix commands with `mise exec --`:

```bash
mise exec -- scripts/generate-template
mise exec -- yamllint .
```

Do **not** assume system-installed tools are correct or present. All managed
tools must be resolved through mise.

`mise.toml` provides:
- **clusterctl**
- **kubectl**
- **kubectl-slice** via the `github:patrickdappollonio/kubectl-slice` backend
- **yamlfmt**
- **yamllint**
- **yq**
- **pre-commit** (available if hooks are added again later)

`json-patch` v5.9.11 is still required by `scripts/generate-template`, but it
could not be resolved portably through a working mise backend in this
environment. Install it manually before regenerating the template, for example
with `go install github.com/evanphx/json-patch/v5/cmd/json-patch@v5.9.11`.

---

## Project Overview

This repository generates the published `template.yaml` for provisioning a Cluster API workload cluster on **Hetzner Cloud** with a **K0smotron** control plane. The final template replaces the generated kubeadm control-plane and worker bootstrap resources with hand-authored `K0smotronControlPlane` and `K0sWorkerConfigTemplate` documents, while keeping Hetzner infrastructure objects and worker `MachineDeployment` resources.

## Template Authoring / Key Patterns

- `scripts/generate-template` starts from `clusterctl generate cluster dummy --infrastructure hetzner:v1.0.6`, then removes the generated kubeadm control-plane and kubeadm worker bootstrap manifests that do not apply to the K0smotron flow.
- The script injects hand-authored `k0smotroncontrolplane.yaml` and `k0sworkerconfig.yaml` documents into `processing/` before patching and formatting the final manifest set.
- Remaining split manifests are patched with same-named RFC6902 files from `patches/`, formatted with `yamlfmt`, wrapped with `---` / `...`, and concatenated into the root `template.yaml`.
- Worker `MachineDeployment` manifests for `nbg1` and `hel1` are cloned from `machinedeployment-fsn1.yaml`, and an OIDC `ClusterResourceSet` is appended from the script heredoc.

---

## Linting and Validation

The primary validation flow is:

```bash
scripts/generate-template
yamllint .
```

CI runs those same checks from `.github/workflows/testing.yml`.
There is no Taskfile or broader compiled test suite in this repository.

## CI / GitHub Actions

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `testing.yml` | `workflow_dispatch`, push to `master`, pull requests to `master` | Sets up mise, regenerates `template.yaml`, and runs `yamllint .` |
| `release.yml` | `workflow_dispatch`, weekly cron (`0 8 * * 1`) | Runs semantic-release and commits the `.github/RELEASE` build timestamp update |
| `automerge.yml` | `workflow_dispatch`, pull requests to `master` | Auto-approves and enables auto-merge for Dependabot pull requests |

## Git & Contribution Conventions

- Commit messages should follow **Conventional Commits**; valid types are
  defined in `.github/semantic.yml`.
- PRs are **squash-merged** (confirmed via `.github/settings.yml`).
- Releases are automated via **semantic-release** (see
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the weekly schedule).
- Security issues → email `security@cloudhippie.de` before opening a public
  issue.

## Key Patterns to Follow

1. **Keep the K0smotron swap explicit**: this repo intentionally removes kubeadm control-plane and worker bootstrap output, then injects `k0smotroncontrolplane.yaml` and `k0sworkerconfig.yaml` instead.
2. **Keep patch/file name parity**: every JSON patch is matched by basename (`patches/<name>.json` ↔ generated `<name>.yaml`). Preserve that convention when adding or renaming resources.
3. **Use placeholders, not environment-specific literals**: the published template must keep `${...}` variables such as `${CLUSTER_NAME}`, `${KUBERNETES_VERSION}`, and machine types intact for downstream consumers.
4. **Treat `machinedeployment-fsn1.yaml` as the canonical worker template**: the `nbg1` and `hel1` documents are derived copies, so structural worker changes should start from the `fsn1` version.
5. **Preserve the appended OIDC resource set**: the final template intentionally adds a ConfigMap plus `ClusterResourceSet` so cluster-specific OIDC RBAC is applied after provisioning.

## Metadata Changes

When updating `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`, treat `AGENTS.md` as
the primary instructions file, and `GEMINI.md`/`CLAUDE.md` as copies that
simply reference it (`@AGENTS.md`).

These files are collectively called the "agent instruction files".
